# Plank overlays generator
This tool generates the CTM overlays for planks next to other types of planks.

## Requirements
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

## How to use
1. Place the regular plank textures in `in/planks`.
2. Place the middle plank CTM textures in `in/ctm`. These are the textures that don't have the borders on the sides.
2. Run `py run.py` in this folder.
3. The output ends up in the `out` folder.
