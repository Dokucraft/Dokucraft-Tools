# Dokucraft Tools
This is a set of tools used to help maintain the Dokucraft resource packs. Some things are very tedious to do manually and so tools have been created to automate what can be automated.

## List of tools
| Tool | Description |
|-|-|
| [Container Generator](container_generator/README.md) | A tool for generating container GUI textures. |
| [Optifine to Fusion Convertor](optifine_to_fusion/README.md) | A tool that converts Optifine CTM to Fusion CTM. |
| [Plank Overlays Generator](plank_overlays_generator/README.md) | Generates CTM overlays for planks next to other types of planks. |
| [Texture Alpha Tools](texture_alpha_tools/README.md) | A set of simple tools for manipulating the alpha channel of textures. |

## External tools
This repo is for tools specifically made to help maintain the Dokucraft packs, but a lot of other, more generic tools are also used for this. This is a list of tools we recommend:
| Tool | Description |
|-|-|
| [Animation Editor](https://stash.dokucraft.co.uk/?animation-editor) | The DokuStash Animation Editor can be used to easily preview and modify block/item animations without having to manually write your own .mcmeta file. |
| [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) | Blockbench is a free low-poly 3D model editor focused on Minecraft-related model types. It can be used to create, modify, and preview block/item models and more. |
| [CEM Template Loader](https://ewanhowell.com/plugins/cem-template-loader) | CEM Template Loader is a plugin for Blockbench that lets you load any entity model from vanilla Minecraft into an OptiFine entity project. It also includes an animation editor that allows you to edit and preview CEM animations directly in Blockbench. |
| [Minecraft Title Generator](https://ewanhowell.com/plugins/minecraft-title-generator) | Minecraft Title Generator is a Blockbench plugin that lets you easily create Minecraft-style title images from any text you want. |
| [minify-zip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minify-zip) | Removes unnecessary parts of ZIP files, making them smaller. The parts that are removed may in some cases have important information, but resource pack ZIP files should always be fine to run through this, unless they are more than 4 GB, which is extremely rare for resource packs. The packs created by the Dokucraft customizer are run through this. |
| [PNGGauntlet](https://pnggauntlet.com/) | PNGGauntlet can easily compress a lot of PNG files in bulk and has a very simple, easy-to-use GUI. Use it to compress all PNGs you add to the pack. |
| [Version Diff](https://cccode.pages.dev/version-diff/) | Version Diff shows the changes to the game assets between two versions. This can be useful if you need to see what files changed in an update so that you know what changes to make to the resource pack for the update. |
